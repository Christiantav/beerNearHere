# beerNearHere
BeerNearHere was the first project competed by our group at the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp. Beer Near Here was a project to bring information about beer to beer lovers. We used the Untappd (https://untappd.com/) api as well as Google maps to connect to area breweries and dispensaries so that beer lovers could enjoy those suds they love so much.
